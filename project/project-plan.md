# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Positional Goal Forecasting: Comparative Analysis in Premier League and La Liga For MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What are the primary contributing factors to the highest number of goals scored from specific positions in both the Premier League and La Liga? 
2. Which specific playing positions tend to score the most goals in each league? How do factors like player attributes, team tactics, or match situations impact goal-scoring from different positions?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The project centers on analyzing player statistics in two of Europe's top football leagues, the Premier League and La Liga. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this endeavor aims to uncover key performance indicators influencing goal-scoring patterns from various player positions. Through the examination of datasets, 'Premier League Player Statistics' and 'La Liga Player Stats,' encompassing player attributes like goals scored, assists, passes completed, shots on target, player positions, and match details, the goal is to develop predictive models. These models will assist in understanding the determinants of successful goal scoring in different positions across both leagues. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to provide insights for optimizing team strategies and player performance, fostering a deeper understanding of impactful metrics in the world of football.

## Datasources
